        <h1>WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?</h1>
        LOREM IPSUM IS SIMPLY DUMMY TEXT OE THE PRINTING AND TYPESETTING INDUSTRY.
        LOREM IPSUM HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY'S STANDARD DUMMY TEXT EVER SINCE THE 1500S,
        WHEN AN UNKNOWN PRINTER TOOK A GALLEY OE TYPE AND SCRAMBLED IT TO MAKE A TYPE
        SPECIMEN BOOK. IT HAS SURVIVED NOT ONLY FIVE CENTURIES, BUT ALSO THE LEAP INTO
        ELECTRONIC TYPESETTING, REMAINING ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED. IT WAS POPULARISED IN
        THE 1960S WITH THE RELEASE OE LETRASET SHEETS CONTAINING LOREM IPSUM PASSAGES,
        AND MORE RECENTLY WITH DESKTOP PUBLISHING SOFTWARE LIKE ALDUS PAGEMAKER INCLUDING
        VERSIONS OF LOREM IPSUM.
        <h1>WHY DO WE USE IT?</h1>
        IT IS A LONG ESTABLISHED FАСТ THAT A READER WILL BE DISTRACTED BY THE READABLE
        CONTENT OE A PAGE WHEN LOOKING AT ITS LAYOUT. THE POINT ОГ USING LOREM IPSUM IS
        THAT IT HAS A MORE-OR-LESS NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF LETTERS, AS OPPOSED TO USING
        'CONTENT HERE, CONTENT HERE', MAKING IT LOOK LIKE READABLE ENGLISH. MANY DESKTOP
        PUBLISHING PACKAGES AND WEB PAGE EDITORS NOW USE LOREM IPSUM AS THEIR DEFAULT MODEL
        TEXT, AND A SEARCH FOR LOREM IPSUM' WILL UNCOVER MANY WEB SITES STILL IN THEIR INFANCY.
        VARIOUS VERSIONS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS, SOMETIMES BY ACCIDENT, SOMETIMES ON PURPOSE
        (INJECTED HUMOUR AND THE LIKE).
        <h1>WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?</h1>
        CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, LOREM IPSUM IS NOT SIMPLY RANDOM TEXT. IT HAS ROOTS
        IN A PIECE OF CLASSICAL LATIN LITERATURE FROM 45 BC, MAKING IT OVER 2000 YEARS OLD.
        RICHARD MCCLINTOCK, A LATIN PROFESSOR AT HAMPDEN SYDNEY COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA, LOOKED
        UP ONE OF THE MORE OBSCURE LATIN WORDS, CONSECTETUR, FROM A LOREM IPSUM PASSAGE, AND
        GOING THROUGH THE CITES OF THE WORD IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE, DISCOVERED THE UNDOUBTABLE
        SOURCE. LOREM IPSUM COMES FROM SECTIONS 1.10.32 AND 1.10.33 OF "DE FINIBUS BONORUM
        ET MALORUM" (THE EXTREMES OF GOOD AND EVIL) BY CICERO, WRITTEN IN 45 BC. THIS BOOK
        IS A TREATISE ON THE THEORY OF ETHICS, VERY POPULAR DURING THE RENAISSANCE. THE FIRST
        LINE OF LOREM IPSUM, "LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET..", COMES FROM A LINE IN SECTION 1.10.32.
        HE STANDARD CHUNK OF LOREM IPSUM USED SINCE THE 1500S IS REPRODUCED BELOW FOR THOSE
        INTERESTED. SECTIONS 1.10.32 AND 1.10.33 FROM "DE FINIBUS BONORUM ET MALORUM” BY CICERO
        ARE ALSO REPRODUCED IN THEIR EXACT ORIGINAL FORM, ACCOMPANIED BY ENGLISH VERSIONS FROM
        THE 1914 TRANSLATION BY H. RACKHAM.
        <h1>WHERE CAN I GET SOME?</h1>
        THFRF ARE MANY VARIATIONS OF PASSAGES OF LORFM IPSUM AVAIl ABLE, BUT THE MAJORITY
        HAVE SUFFERED ALTERATION IN SOME FORM, BY INJECTED HUMOUR, OR RANDOMISED WORDS WHICH DON'T
        LOOK EVEN SLIGHTLY BELIEVABLE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A PASSAGE OF LOREM IPSUM, YOU NEED TO BE SURE THERE
        ISN'T
        ANYTHING EMBARRASSING HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF TEXT ALL THE LOREM IPSUM
