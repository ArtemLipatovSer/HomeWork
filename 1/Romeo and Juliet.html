        <h3 style="color:#78789a">ACT 1</h3>
        <h3 style="color:#78789a">PROLOGUE</h3>
        Two households, both alike in dignity.<br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br> 
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br> 
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br> 
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br> 
        A pair of star-cioss'd loveis take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
        And the continuance of their patents' rage,<br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
        <h3 style="color:#78789a">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
        <i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
        <h3 style="color:#78789a">SAMPSON</h3>
        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
        <h3 style="color:#78789a">GREGORY</h3>
        No, for then we should be colliers.
